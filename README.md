# Bikesharing

## Overview

Make a sub-heading

The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing business in Des Moines is a good idea.  We are doing this by showing various visualizations of bike-sharing data in New York City that was taken in August 2019.

## Results

- Who uses the bike-sharing program? 

  - There were over 2 million trips in one month. More than 3/4 of them were subscribers, and less than 1/4 were per-trip users.

## Summary

make a sub-heading - high level summary and 2 additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis

The link to my public Tableau story is here:

To summarize, bikes are used most often:

- By males
- During rush-hours and on weekends

Here are some additional visualizations that could be made using the same data set:

- How many trips per day are being made by gender.
- Breakdown of customers vs subscribers by gender.
