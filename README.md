# Bikesharing

## Overview

Make a sub-heading

The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing business in Des Moines is a good idea.  We are doing this by showing various visualizations of bike-sharing data in New York City that was taken in August 2019.

## Results

make a sub-heading - there needs to be 7 and there needs to be a description and results for each and embed the Tableau link

Here are the various story pages I presented:
- Who uses the bike-sharing program? 

  - We find that there were over 2 million trips in one month. More than 3/4 of them were subscribers, and less than 1/4 were per-trip users.

- What are the peak hours? 

- 

- How long are their trips? How many trips are there per weekday for each hour?



## Summary

make a sub-heading - high level summary and 2 additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis

- Bikes are used mostly be males
- The peak are in the morning afnd after work
- Their trips are x minues long

Two additional charts could be: 
Birth year and subscriber
Something with gender
